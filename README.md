# VendingMachineKata

This project was done to show use of object oriented programming, as well as unit tests.
This project was designed with the assumption that a user interface would be implemented by another team. 
The methods in this project handle user requests and return the actions that should then be called by the user interface.

NuGet Packages Used:
NUnit v. 2.6.4
NUnit Test Adapter v. 2.1.1
